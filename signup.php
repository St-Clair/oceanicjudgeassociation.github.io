									            </header>
											    <p>Becoming an accredited Judge requires you to work at least 1 event with an L2 or higher Judge, who will mentor you on your learning journey.<br>
                                                If you live remote this requirement can be waived at the discretion of your mentor in communication with other high level Judges.<br>
                                                A nominal fee and internet access is also required.
                                                </p>
                                                <h3>If you can meet these requirements continue below to start your Judge journey!</h3>

												    <h3><strong>2: Learn Rules and Policy</strong></h3>
									            </header>
											    <p>Begin studying the <a href='https://mtgdoc.link/cr'><strong>Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules</strong></a>, <a href='https://mtgdoc.link/mtr'><strong>Magic Tournament Rules (MTR)</strong></a>, and <a href='https://mtgdoc.link/jar'><strong>Judging at Regular (JAR)</strong></a> documents.<br>
                                                While you can study independently using the resources at the bottom of the page, working with an L2+ Judge mentor is highly recommended.<br>
                                                A mentor can guide you through complex rules interactions, share practical judging experience, help you prepare for certification, and answer questions as they arise.<br>
                                                Many aspiring judges find that having someone to discuss scenarios and review practice questions with significantly accelerates their learning and confidence.<br>
                                                If you have difficulty finding a mentor, you can reach out to OJA for a recommendation.
